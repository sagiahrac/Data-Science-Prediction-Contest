# Overview

This repository contains a report on a classification contest I participated in.

You can find information about the contest in the final_project_instructions.pdf file, details on the data exploration phase in the Part1-ExploratoryDataAnalysis.pdf document, and information on machine learning and deep learning applied to the preprocessed data in the Part2-ML4Prediction.pdf file.

The findings presented in this report proudly secured the 2nd place for peak accuracy and the 1st place for average best accuracy.
